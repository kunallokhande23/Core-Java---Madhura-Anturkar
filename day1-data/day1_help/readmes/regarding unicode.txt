What is Unicode ?

The Unicode-characters are universal characters encoding standard. It represents way different characters can be represented in different documents like text file, web pages etc. 

It is the industry standard designed to consistently and uniquely encode characters used in written languages throughout the world. 

The Unicode standard uses hexadecimal to express a character.
For example the value 0x0041 represents  A.

The ASCII character set contained limited number of characters. It doesn't have Japanese characters , can't support Devnagari scripts.

The idea behind Unicode was to create a single character set that included every reasonable character in all writing systems in the world. 

The Unicode standard was initially designed using 16 bits to encode characters because the primary machines were 16-bit PCs. When the specification for the Java language was created, the Unicode standard was accepted and the char primitive was defined as a 16-bit data type, with characters in the hexadecimal range from 0x0000 to 0xFFFF.
