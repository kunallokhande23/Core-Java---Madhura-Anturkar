1. byte: The byte data type is an 8-bit signed two's complement integer. It has a minimum value of -128 and a maximum value of 127 (inclusive). --- -2^7 ---- 2^7-1
2. short: The short data type is a 16-bit signed two's complement integer. It has a minimum value of -32,768 and a maximum value of 32,767 (inclusive).
-2^15 ---- 2^15-1
3.int: The int data type is a 32-bit signed two's complement integer. It has a minimum value of -2,147,483,648 and a maximum value of 2,147,483,647 (inclusive).
4. long: The long data type is a 64-bit signed two's complement integer. It has a minimum value of -9,223,372,036,854,775,808 and a maximum value of 9,223,372,036,854,775,807 (inclusive).

5.float: The float data type is a single-precision 32-bit IEEE 754 floating point.
Covers a range from 1.40129846432481707e-45 to 3.40282346638528860e+38 (positive or negative). 
BE careful -- in assigning integer to float & vice versa.

6. double :  8 bytes IEEE 754. Covers a range from 4.94065645841246544e-324d to 1.79769313486231570e+308d (positive or negative). 

7. boolean 
    Typically 1-bit(as per underlying JVM specification)  May take on the values true and false only.
    true and false are defined constants of the language. Booleans may not be cast into any other type of variable nor may any other variable be cast into a boolean.

8. char -- unsigned char. --- UTF 16 
range 0----65535
