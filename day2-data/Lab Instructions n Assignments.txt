Day 1
0. Download n extract today's contents.

1. Please revise today's work , using the "sequence.txt"

2. Go through day1/code : all code samples

3. Solve ready code samples n revise completely.
Main revision topics  : Java control structures , loops, primitive types , automatic n forced conversions(type casting)
operators , basics of class programming  , classes , objects , constructor , this keyword.
(refer to "regarding class n object.txt")
For unicode : refer to "day1-data\day1_help\readmes\regarding unicode"

4. No hands-on assignment for today.

Day 2
1. Refer to today's sequence
refer : day2-data\code without IDE\day2
n revise packages , access specifiers

2. import day2.1 in your eclipse workspace n revise code with mem pics.
(refer : whiteboard-mem-pics.png)

DO NOT copy n run below  code in IDE.
You have to go through the code n answer.

3. Solve Tank assignment along with memory picture.

What will be the output ?

class Tank {
  private int level;
  Tank(int l)
   {
     level=l;
   }
  public void setLevel(int level1)
  {
    level=level1;
  }
  public int getLevel()
  {
    return level;
  }
}	

public class Assignment {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Tank t1 = new Tank(10);
    Tank t2 = new Tank(20);
     s.o.p("1: t1.level: " + t1.getLevel() +
          ", t2.level: " + t2.getLevel());//10 20
    t1 = t2;//1st tank obj is marked GC
    s.o.p("2: t1.level: " + t1.getLevel() +
          ", t2.level: " + t2.getLevel());//20 20
    t1.setLevel(27);
     s.o.p("3: t1.level: " + t1.getLevel() +
          ", t2.level: " + t2.getLevel());//27 27
    t2.setLevel(t1.getLevel()+10);
     s.o.p("4: t1.level: " + t1.getLevel() +
          ", t2.level: " + t2.getLevel());//37 37
  }
}
